PROBLEMS:
1. How does this scale? Probably badly with current implementation

IDEAS:
* Parallel sampling?

TODO:
V Shuffled X by batch
V Mercedes set
V L0 norm
- Start tspan at 0
- Make all variables learnable:
    - A
    - x
    - s
    - l1
    - l0
- Make code faster
- Discrete SC
- LCA

QUESTIONS:

1. Why is A.T @ A sparse?
2. What are conditions of convergence for Langevin equations
