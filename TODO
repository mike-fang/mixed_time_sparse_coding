PROBLEMS:
1. How does this scale? Probably badly with current implementation

IDEAS:
* Parallel sampling?
    Should be fine, take s to {s1, s2, .., sN}, N being the batch size

TODO:
V Shuffled X by batch
V Mercedes set
V L0 norm
V Start tspan at 0
V Implement parallel sampling
    V make loader
    V write solver
    V update plotter
- Make all variables learnable:
    - A
    - x
    - s
    - l1
    - l0
V Make code faster
V Discrete SC
- LCA

QUESTIONS:

1. Why is A.T @ A sparse?
2. What are conditions of convergence for Langevin equations
