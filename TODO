PROBLEMS:
1. How does this scale? Probably badly with current implementation

IDEAS:
* Parallel sampling?
    Should be fine, take s to {s1, s2, .., sN}, N being the batch size

TODO:
- Make loader module
V Shuffled X by batch
V Mercedes set
V L0 norm
V Start tspan at 0
V Implement parallel sampling
    V make loader
    V write solver
    V update plotter

- Make all variables learnable:
    v A
    - x
    v s
    - l1
    - l0
V Make code faster
V Discrete SC
- LCA

QUESTIONS:

1. Why is A.T @ A sparse?
2. What are conditions of convergence for Langevin equations
3. What is the non-eq distribution for T < infty? Could we use that?
    - For uniform potential, the distribution of final position should be guassian with variance = t.
        -Probably no good for T << T_eq, the trajectory is highly correlated (maybe?)
